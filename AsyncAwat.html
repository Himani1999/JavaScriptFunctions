Async :- It simply allows us to write promises based code.  Async functions will always return a value. 
It makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then javascript 
automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value.

Await :- Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only. 
It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.
